## Additional Features
### Image Loading Blur
- All images utilise a loading blur function to smooth out their loading as the high-quality images can slow things down.
- The function places a low-quality thumbnail as the default image, covering it with a CSS blur filter.
- Simultaneously, it loads the full quality image set as the background image. Once it detects it is loaded it adds a class.
- The class makes the thumbnail transparent, using animation to smooth the transition.
- Had to be carefully used to correctly open the image modal.

### Email
- EmailJS is functional on every page through the newsletter form.
- The newsletter form has all the same basic features, like the contact form; validation, the modal, success and error messages are all present.
- Differentiates between the contact page form for messages and the newsletter form.

## Feature Ideas
### Basic
- A selection of countries to click on that brings you directly to the gallery.
- The ability to share photos directly to social media.
- Purchasing on the site
- More details about countries.

### Content 
- A wider range of countries and images. At the moment I didn't want to clutter the map.
- The user selects a country and an API pull in relevant images of that location.
- An API wherein the placename and the blurb are automatically generated.
- Blog posts on the website for more flavour text.

# Testing
## Methods
### Validation
- HTML has been validated with [W3C HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- CSS has been validated with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and auto-prefixed with [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).
- Links checked with [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink).
- Each javascript file was tested on the site for errors and functionality using the console and with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

### General Testing
- Each feature was developed and tested in its own branch before being merged with master. Branches were subsequently deleted.
- Each time a feature was added, all the functions were tested to see if there was an impact.
- The site was sent to friends for feedback and testing.
- All forms have validation and will not submit without the proper information.
- .gitignore file has been included to prevent system file commits.
- The image loading blur has been thoroughly tested and gone through numerous iterations to optimise the smoothness of the transition on different devices and internet speeds.
- Backup Map functions have been tested in a local deployment.
- Email error functions have been tested offline as well.
- External links open in a new tab.

### Mobile Testing
- I tested the site personally on my Android device, going through the entire process, checking buttons, functions, checking out, etc. I was personally unable to test on iOS.
- The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, including iOS.
- Chrome was utilised to inspect the site in mobile format, going through the pages and functions.

### Desktop Testing
- The site was developed on a Chromebook and, as such, the majority of testing occurred on Chrome.
- The site was tested by friends and relatives on numerous desktop devices.
- The site was marginally tested on other browsers, such as Firefox and Edge.
- Internet Explorer was not tested and the site was not developed with it in mind as support for the browser is gradually being dropped.

## Bugs
### Known Bugs
- Occasionally on a device with low RAM, the Google Maps API won't load.
- Devices with low RAM may have stuttered animations.
- Offline, using the backup map, the images don't switch the first time the page loads. No errors are shown on the console. A refresh usually solves the issue.
- Very slow connections may have users see the thumbnails pop in during iframe loading, rather than having the switch occur during the animation.

### Fixed Bugs
- Jumbotron image wouldn't de-blur. Fixed by adding a custom class for selection and differentiation.
- Markers wouldn't load if the connection to the API was slow. Fixed by adding a backup array to be used as a fall-back.
- EmailJS wasn't allowing newsletters to be sent on the contact page. Fixed by giving each form a separate ID.
- The map info window wouldn't dispose of itself but would open multiple instances, one over the other. Fixed by moving the initialisation instance outside of the click function.
- The info window would concatenate one country's information with another after clicked. Fixed by clearing the info window content on each click before populating it with info.
- If a country had multiple first languages, the info window would have a display that clipped them as they were stored in an array themselves. Fixed by writing a custom function to deal with languages.
- All map markers would bounce if they had animations set to active. Fixed by looping through the markers and setting them to no animation before activating the clicked marker's animation.
- The modal for images in the gallery wouldn't open because of the blur function. Fixed by changing the HTML structure on the page and the iframe.
- One I added SASS, many of the site's display features were broken. Fixed by cleaning up the CSS files and removing clashing styles.

# Deployment
## Local Deployment
### Local Preparation
**Requirements:**
- An IDE of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You will have to set up a connection with an email server through EmailJS:
- You will have to install SASS to compile the CSS. This depends on your system and your method choice. Please see the instructions [here](https://sass-lang.com/install).

### Local Instructions
1. Download a copy of the project repository [here](https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/neverlost-thrift/archive/master.zip) and extract the zip file to your base folder. Or you can clone the repository with:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/neverlost-thrift
    ```
    To disconnect it from the master repository, use:
    ```
    git remote rm origin
    ```
2. Open your IDE and choose the base directory.
3. Here you can install SASS with npm, if you choose, with:
    ```
    npm install -g sass
    ```
4. Run the compiler with:
    ```
    sass --watch assets/css/bootstrap_sass:assets/css
    ```
    This will also watch the bootstrap_sass folder for changes and re-compile the CSS when they are made. This way you can make changes quickly and not worry about re-compiling.
6. Switch the user token for EmailJS with your own. It can be found in the head tag:
    ```
    (function () {
        emailjs.init("<your user token>");
    })();
    ```
5. Run the project with your chosen method. You can drop index.html into a web browser and it should run fine, open a local port and access it or, if you have python installed, run it on an HTTP server with python with a command such as:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
6. Enjoy the site!

## Github Deployment
### Github Preparation
- It is possible to copy or clone the repository to directly for deployment, but you will have to compile the make sure the SCSS compiles correctly first. Github Pages' Jekyll themes support this but you will have to make some customisations. Details can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).
**Requirements:**
- A free GitHub account.
- A free EmailJS account.

### Github Instructions
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
navigate to [https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/neverlost-thrift](https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/neverlost-thrift).
1. You can set up your own repository and copy or clone it, or you fork the repository.
2. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to a GitHub repository, if necessary.
3. GitHub pages will update from the master branch by default.
4. Go to the **Settings** page of the repository.
5. Scroll down to the **Github Pages** section.
7. Select the Master Branch as the source and **Confirm** the selection.
8. Wait a minute or two and it should be live for viewing. See my own [here](https://ri-dearg.github.io/horizon-photo/).
