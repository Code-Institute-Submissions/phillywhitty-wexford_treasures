### SEO

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/testing/userstories/facebook_wex_treasures.png" alt="facebook-page">
</div>



## Bugs
### Known Bugs
- Occasionally on a device with low RAM, the Google Maps API won't load.
- Devices with low RAM may have stuttered animations.
- Offline, using the backup map, the images don't switch the first time the page loads. No errors are shown on the console. A refresh usually solves the issue.
- Very slow connections may have users see the thumbnails pop in during iframe loading, rather than having the switch occur during the animation.

### Fixed Bugs
- Jumbotron image wouldn't de-blur. Fixed by adding a custom class for selection and differentiation.
- Markers wouldn't load if the connection to the API was slow. Fixed by adding a backup array to be used as a fall-back.
- EmailJS wasn't allowing newsletters to be sent on the contact page. Fixed by giving each form a separate ID.
- The map info window wouldn't dispose of itself but would open multiple instances, one over the other. Fixed by moving the initialisation instance outside of the click function.
- The info window would concatenate one country's information with another after clicked. Fixed by clearing the info window content on each click before populating it with info.
- If a country had multiple first languages, the info window would have a display that clipped them as they were stored in an array themselves. Fixed by writing a custom function to deal with languages.
- All map markers would bounce if they had animations set to active. Fixed by looping through the markers and setting them to no animation before activating the clicked marker's animation.
- The modal for images in the gallery wouldn't open because of the blur function. Fixed by changing the HTML structure on the page and the iframe.
- One I added SASS, many of the site's display features were broken. Fixed by cleaning up the CSS files and removing clashing styles.

# Deployment
## Local Deployment
### Local Preparation
**Requirements:**
- An IDE of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You will have to set up a connection with an email server through EmailJS:
- You will have to install SASS to compile the CSS. This depends on your system and your method choice. Please see the instructions [here](https://sass-lang.com/install).

### Local Instructions
1.  You can clone the repository with:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/phillywhitty/wexford_treasures.git
    ```
    To disconnect it from the master repository, use:
    ```
    git remote rm origin
    ```
2. Open your IDE and choose the base directory.
3. Here you can install SASS with npm, if you choose, with:
    ```
    npm install -g sass
    ```
4. Run the compiler with:
    ```
    sass --watch assets/css/bootstrap_sass:assets/css
    ```
    This will also watch the bootstrap_sass folder for changes and re-compile the CSS when they are made. This way you can make changes quickly and not worry about re-compiling.
6. Switch the user token for EmailJS with your own. It can be found in the head tag:
    ```
    (function () {
        emailjs.init("<your user token>");
    })();
    ```
5. Run the project with your chosen method. You can drop index.html into a web browser and it should run fine, open a local port and access it or, if you have python installed, run it on an HTTP server with python with a command such as:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
6. Enjoy the site!

## Github Deployment
### Github Preparation
- It is possible to copy or clone the repository to directly for deployment, but you will have to compile the make sure the SCSS compiles correctly first. Github Pages' Jekyll themes support this but you will have to make some customisations. Details can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).
**Requirements:**
- A free GitHub account.

### Github Instructions
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
navigate to [https://github.com/phillywhitty/wexford_treasures.git](https://github.com/phillywhitty/wexford_treasures.git).
1. You can set up your own repository and copy or clone it, or you fork the repository.
2. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to a GitHub repository, if necessary.
3. GitHub pages will update from the master branch by default.
4. Go to the **Settings** page of the repository.
5. Scroll down to the **Github Pages** section.
7. Select the Master Branch as the source and **Confirm** the selection.
8. Wait a minute or two and it should be live for viewing.

## Credits and Contact
### Content
Nearly all text content was generated by the AI, GPT-4. Especially for product names as I had some many. I also generated random skus using chat-gpt. It certainly helps and found it great
at explaining certain terms but it can be very undependable in certain circumstances and I always double checked any text I generated using it.
Most of my Images were screenshots of certain hampers across sites such as (https://hampersdirect.ie/) (https://hampershop.ie/) and then I also used Canva.
I used screenshots but then always made sure to change to title and description of products and made up random prices.
I felt I had to use hamper images off certain websites for a consistent look for my images as Canva didnt have enough category hamper images.

### Acknowledgements
- A huge shoutout to Rory Patrick Sheridan for being an amazing mentor throughout the course.
  He's fantastic at breaking down concepts, and I learned a ton from him, especially considering I came in without any IT background.
  Whenever I had questions, he was quick to respond, and he made our online sessions really enjoyable. His support really boosted my confidence.
  A pure gentleman !!
- I also want to give a big shoutout to Kera Cudmore on Slack. 
  Whenever I encountered issues, I reached out to her, and her guidance along with the resources she shared always proved incredibly helpful.
  Kera is actively engaged on Slack, offering assistance to numerous individuals. 
  Her dedication and wealth of knowledge are truly inspiring.
- I'd also like to extend my gratitude to everyone I interacted with at student support. 
  Their outstanding support greatly contributed to my learning journey and helped me immensely in navigating challenges.
